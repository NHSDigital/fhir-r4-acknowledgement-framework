The Acknowlegdment Framework aims to become a generic and agnostic solution that will support any future healthcare system using any transport method. We envisage to promote this to be used for projects that will use FHIR R4 in the future.

The Acknowledgement Framework is in a draft state of development so please contact the IOPS Team if your product or programme would be interested to discuss this potential solution.

##Use Cases
GP Registration - Patient registers online to join a GP practice
Galleri Pilot - Receive bio-sampling test results
Other use cases can be included in the near future
